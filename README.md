## My Resume Site
<br>
This site is the same that powers my resume site at [iamdb.co](https://iamdb.co). It's built upon [React Start Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) and, in addition, I'm using the [Lost](https://github.com/peterramsing/lost) grid system for CSS layout.

The server is hosted by [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com), SSL certificates provided by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and deployed using [dokku-alt](https://github.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt).
