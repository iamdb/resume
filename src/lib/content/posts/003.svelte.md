title: Rounded corners on HTML tables

I ran into a an issue building these pages where an HTML `<table>` would not display rounded corners unless the borders were separated.

```css
table {
	border-collapse: separate;
}
```

According to the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-collapse) page on `border-collapse`:

> The border-collapse CSS property sets whether cells inside a `<table>` have shared or separate borders.

The link has a good demo that illustrates the difference.
