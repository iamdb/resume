This isn't anything new or innovative because it's been in the language since ES1, but wanted to preserve it somewhere for reference.

Javascript offers the `.localeCompare()` method on strings that not only compares strings from different languages, but will ignore case if you want it to **and** returns the proper sorting integer to return in a `.sort()` callback.

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare) offers the following array sorting example:

> ```javascript
> const items = ['réservé', 'Premier', 'Cliché', 'communiqué', 'café', 'Adieu'];
>
> items.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b, 'fr', { ignorePunctuation: true }));
>
> // ['Adieu', 'café', 'Cliché', 'communiqué', 'Premier', 'réservé']
> ```

It also has a note for performance:

> When comparing large numbers of strings, such as in sorting large arrays, it is better to create an [`Intl.Collator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator) object and use the function provided by its [`compare()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator/compare) method.
