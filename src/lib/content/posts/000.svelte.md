title: What am I thinking?

For various reasons I have never written consistently. As I've gotten older, I have realized how much writing helps me think. It's like defragmenting my brain, taking all the various thoughts and give them shape.

Since most of my writing these days is about my coding work personally and professionally, I figured I would start putting some of it here in case some one else finds it useful.

The topics will mostly be me describing some process I recently went through for the first time, information I just want to keep around for my own reference and updates about personal projects I'm working on.

Also, the name "Brain Droppings" is lovingly taken from George Carlin's book of the same name.
